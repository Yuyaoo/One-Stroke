## FAQ
1. Q: Can I visit on a vertex more than once? 
   A: Yes. In fact, it is impossible to solve some puzzles if you don't do so. 
2. Q: Can I visit a path more than once? 
   A: At the moment, no. However, this is a good idea. Multiple-visitable paths sounds like a constraint that could increase the difficulty of the game.
